# USB Debugging

USB debugging allows your device to communicate with another device over USB. It's a very important step for installing new software on your device, so you'll see instructions to "enable USB debugging" quite often!

## Enabling USB Debugging

1. Go to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section

    *Tip: If you already have "Developer options" under System, go directly to #5.*
2. Tap on "About phone"
3. Tap "Build number" 7 times until you get a message
   that says you are now a developer
4. Go back to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section again
5. Tap on "Developer options"
6. Ensure that "USB debugging" is enabled
7. Tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you to allow USB Debugging for
   your computer's RSA key fingerprint (you may have to do this multiple
   times unless you check "Always allow from this computer")

Remember that you will have to enable USB Debugging again whenever your device factory resets (after unlocking your bootloader for example) or completes a fresh install.
